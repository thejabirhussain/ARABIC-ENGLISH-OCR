of property, suction and equipment and conducted an assessment to calculate the recoverable values of these

Based on this practice, the recoverable values were higher than the book values of the relevant cash generation units and no loss was recorded in the value as it relates to the relevant money generation units for the year.

Preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make the most accurate estimates and assumptions as of the date of preparation of the consolidated financial reports, which may affect the amounts of income, expenses, assets, recorded liabilities and disclosures..

These estimates and assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable according to circumstances and are used to measure the book values of assets and liabilities that are difficult to obtain from other sources..  The estimates and assumptions involved are constantly reviewed..

3.1 (Estimates and assumptions (concluded)

3.1.2 Rate of additional borrowing of leases (see illustrations 8 and 22)

The group cannot easily determine the implied commission rate on leases, so it uses the additional borrowing rate to measure lease obligations..  The additional borrowing rate represents the commission rate at which a group has to pay to borrow funds to acquire an asset of a value similar to that of a right-of-use in a similar economic environment, over a similar period and with a similar security..  Thus, the additional borrowing rate reflects what the group has to pay, which requires an estimate when observable rates are not available – such as for dependents who do not make financing transactions – or when they have to be adjusted to reflect the severity of the lease..

3.1.3 Measurement of financial instruments (see explanations 51, 31, 21 and 11)

The Group shall express its opinion on the basis of determining the fair value of investments in equity instruments or derivatives by reference to similar types of investments sold on the market..

Or derivatives to determine the basis requires management to make judgments to prove investments in equity instruments and derivatives.  To determine fair value, these investments are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 or 3 (see illustration)..

3.1.4 Apportionment (see explanation) 42

SABIC is exposed to systemic, environmental and regulatory risks.  This may include non-compliance with the competition regime and the procurement process, export control, data protection, intellectual property rights, and tax and environmental legislation..

Allocations, depending on their nature, are based on estimates and valuations to ascertain whether evidentiary standards have been met, including an estimate of the likelihood of cash outflows.  Management's estimate of the allocation for environmental matters is based on the estimation of fiber, after taking into account legal advice and other information..

Provisions of contracts for which a liability is considered to be greater than its benefits or unconfirmed liabilities involve management's best judgment as to whether outflows are probable.

3.1.5 Specific employee benefits programmes (see explanation) 32

Post-employment defined benefit programmes, end-of-service programmes, statutory compensation liabilities and other long-term employee benefits represent future liabilities due to service rendered by employees..  These arrangements require actuarial valuations to measure these liabilities..  The group should make assumptions about variables such as discount rates, salary increments, longevity, attrition rates and future health care costs, if applicable..  Changes in underlying assumptions can have a significant impact on expected benefit obligations and the subsequent generation of specific employee benefits..

Interest obligations set at a specified price are deducted by reference to the relevant market returns at the end of the reporting period, on high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds, if there is no deep market in such high-grade corporate bonds..  Important provisions must be made when setting standards for bonds to be included in the society from which the yield curve was derived..
